In [[How can we develop transformative tools for thought]], MN and AM discuss the insight-through-making loop, and how we need applied researchers in this field due to the severeness of the public goods issue and also that neither pure research nor pure development will be enough. Especially in this field, pure researchers can't seem to make their ideas spread hard enough because they can't focus on (read: scoff at) the aspects of [[How to make ideas spread]]/[[How to Build a Movement]]. Pure engineers are often disincentivized by the public goods issue + they won't bother to spend the time actually looking deep for what can push the boundaries of how we think. 
New innovations in tfts must come from somewhere outside of both fields that takes the best of both worlds. 

I understand this. But I seem to have overestimated my design + development skills. I will work on these over time, but I think the best way to have an impact in the near future is through bringing the research aspect from about 15% to about 30% of the time I spend on this. At the same time, I'm not sure short-term impact is what I should be optimizing for here, especially since the chances of having a real impact are pretty low either way. I started this note with the intention of deciding to focus more on research, but I think I've convinced myself to keep it as is.
