In the words of several of the pioneers, tfts are:
> “A context in which the user can have new kinds of thought, thoughts that were formerly impossible for them” - Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen

> “A means of increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems.” - Doug Engelbart

> “A truly new medium [where] the very use of it would change the thought patterns of an entire civilization” - Alan Kay


Doug Engelbart's is particularly exciting because idt we have anything that can merge all of these effortlessly - yet. With the right practices someone could be using some form of [[Evergreen Notes]] to map out concept spaces and push their thought to a new problem, they might be gaining comprehension through note-taking and srs systems, and they might be deriving solutions to problems by writing through their ideas and stuff like that, but that takes master use. 

Let's break it down: 
a) approach a complex problem situation: I think there's no other way to do this than serious [[Evergreen Notes]] and deep thinking (both of which should support each other; evergreen notes should fuel deeper thinking and deeper thinking should lead to new evergreen notes). **Maybe there's some kind of environment you can design that promotes better thinking in other ways as well?**
b) gain comprehension: There aren't very good and established practices for when you should use what, but with a mixture of note-taking and srs systems I think that you can do this. Other things that could make it better: automatic skimmer that helps you focus on higher quality content, and [[Making Massive Input Better]] + learning how to [[Dealing with lots of good content]]. Basically, there should be support for both deep learning (enforced non-skimming, ai-generated flashcards that show up every few minutes and essentially transform any text into a mnemonic medium) and massive input.
c) Derive solutions to problems: I don't really know about this yet. Something that supports thinking and writing and understanding and creating new solutions. **This would probably come down to design ideas and some kind of AI that can reason with you and push your thinking, like rubber duck but for thought?**
