How can we make it easier to learn faster while also increasing the ability to recall and use that knowledge?

I think this problem can be broken down to two parts. 
1. Better ways to search and gather information
2. Better recall and application

Linus Lee is doing a lot of great work on #1 (https://thesephist.com/posts/monocle/, https://thesephist.com/posts/browser/, https://thesephist.com/posts/search-vs-nav/), and Andy Matuschak is one of the leading figures on #2 (https://andymatuschak.org/books, https://andymatuschak.org/prompts, https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z244xx3kMf1v8UnkZKUwQBAwBsHLpUgN4YhsG).
