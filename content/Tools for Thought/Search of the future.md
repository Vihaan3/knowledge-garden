I think that the future of information collection ([[Search Engines vs AI]]) will probably help solve [[Making Massive Input Better]]. 

- [[A personal search database that interfaces not only with just your own notes but also the notes of other knowledge gardens]]
- The ideas around integrating your note-taking tools and srs system directly with the articles you read and being able to note-take within posts directly within your browser and being able to see them when you revisit.
- Automatic summaries of pages when you visit them
- Top highlights made by users are visible to everyone like kindle highlighting
- You can tag individual tabs better and maybe even write a summary of why you want to read it and by when or something
- SRS spacing on tabs
- Version control like Git but with search
	- The ability to save a specific branch for the future so that you can dive into the rabbit hole again and be able to see what you were doing and what your flows were
- Predictive search paths
- Collaboration (you can start a browsing session)
- Obsidian-style graph of the web (maybe the tabs you have open and/or search history)
- I should be able to rank certain content sources, and they should be more highly featured in future searches
- Useful features from existing search engines
