[[Ideas as social graphs]]
[[Idea Triggers]]
[[How do researchers get new ideas]]
[[Why conversations lead to so many good ideas]]
**Also, one of the best ways to increase that serendipity is through building** [[Social Infrastructure]]

This is a key aspect of building tools for thought, and this is probably what will be key to creating better future tools for thought. Some things will probably help with this.
- Better visual design of how concepts interconnect
- Better AI processing of how ideas connect
- More conversational-like thinking somehow [[Why conversations lead to so many good ideas]]

AI tagging + creating a vector embedding of each note related to each other based on some formula of AI tags, manual links by you, similarities in words, how often you view them in relation to each other. There would have to be a complete overload of note-taking apps; this is an idea-capture place first. There would also have to be easy ways of capturing ideas and monitoring how often you’re thinking about it. You’ll have to understand a lot of the principles behind what leads to good ideas, how ideas are stored in the brain, how they’re connected, etc. Whenever you have good ideas, try to hunt down what triggers and interactions between ideas caused it. Try to get some smart ppl from lost ones doing this too.
