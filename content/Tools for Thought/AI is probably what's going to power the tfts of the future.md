This is something I realized yesterday. 

Currently I've been binging the work of Linus Lee as obsessively as I was binging the work of Andy Matuschak: https://every.to/chain-of-thought/linus-lee-is-living-with-ai (here's a good introduction). He uses AI to create tools for thought that have new space representation, new notation, and search. Better AI tools are going to revolutionize the tfts of the future, and running away from it is something that will lead me to develop tools that are out of step with what is actually possible. 

I think this is something I intuitively realized last week with all of my different project ideas that used Ai to a large extent. For some reason, I wasn't fully able to connect the dots until yesterday while talking to [[Jacob GW]] about boosting serendipity and creating a copilot for writing/note-taking. 

AI is going to revolutionize the way we work, and running away from AI like I have been doing is stupid. 

[[AI is going to unlock research opportunities]] is another important thing I can use to enhance the research aspect of my work.
