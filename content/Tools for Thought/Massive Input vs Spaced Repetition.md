Primarily inspired by [[Elijah Bodden]]'s idea that school should be geared towards massive input to train our brains to optimize for learning (the more you learn, the more sophisticated your brain becomes at developing structures that optimize for learning which is something that [[Jacob GW]] talks abt)

reminded of this by https://nintil.com/massive-input-spaced-repetition

Nintil suggests that you should massive input most things and use spaced repetition for things that you especially have to remember. Massive input until you have a map of the territory and then build off of that with srs as needed. This seems correct to some extent.

Talked to [[Jacob GW]] abt this, and he suggests that massive input works best in domains where there's immediate feedback like coding or learning rubix cubes. In other domains, srs provides the immediate feedback.

This makes me wonder about [[Making Massive Input Better]].

I think I'll take a mixed approach here. I like the idea that not everything should go into your memory system, but I also like the immediate feedback heuristic Jacob provides. 

## Massive Input vs Spaced Repetition Research
I want to research into whether there's even better heuristics for when to use massive input and when to use spaced repetition for coming up with better ideas/getting to the edge of your field. I want to pioneer a new approach that combines the two into a system that can be used effectively for whatever you need. 

A few research questions and directions:
1. Is there evidence that one is better than the other in certain scenarios, and if not, can you do research towards that?
	1. What differentiates language learning from physics or something like that? What are the best ways to learn languages?
	2. [[How do researchers get new ideas]], and do they use one of these over others traditionally?
3. How can we structure massive input slightly more to make it more effective? (This probably comes from answering the question what is massive input trying to optimize for) Most likely this is going to look like a lot of the work Linus Lee has done with making skimmers and easily searchable personal knowledge databases.
