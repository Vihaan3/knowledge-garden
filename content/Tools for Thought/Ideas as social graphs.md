From [[Elijah Bodden]], on 2-26, really awesome idea that maybe the reason we're so good at learning when we can make ideas interconnect is because evolution has forced us to be really good at keeping track of social relationship and social graphs. A good way to build off of this could be to explore [[Why conversations lead to so many good ideas]] and making ideas engage in conversation???

## Interesting follow-ups from this idea
1. We should look into building graph views that are more navigable and even better illustrate the connections as a social graph.
	1. Using AI we can build vector embeddings for notes similar to how AI does that for words based on some way of determining similarity + maybe you don't always want to determine similarity
2. This is probably a good mental model for tft researchers when thinking about how to help people remember more + have better ideas.
3. **This is probably a good mental model for what good evergreen notes should look like (dense because each person has a story, well-linked because every person has relationships to each other, atomic because each person is an individual, etc)**
4. Having some cool feature where AI can make 2+ notes "have a conversation" in some way?
