>  I've spent a lot of time over the years desperately trying to think of a "thing" to change the world. I now know why the search was fruitless -- things _don't_ change the world. _People_ change the world by using things. The focus must be on the "using", not the "thing". Now that I'm looking through the right end of the binoculars, I can see a lot more clearly, and there are projects and possibilities that genuinely interest me deeply.
