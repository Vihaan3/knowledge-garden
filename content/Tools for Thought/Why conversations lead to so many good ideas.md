This is an interesting part of [[Serendipitous Idea-Formation]], so I want to know more about this and maybe how some of these principles could serve as inspiration for other better tools for thought. 

- High chance that someone else might have similar but slightly different ideas to something you're thinking about, which can help you riff off of each other -> AI and better conversations for research.
	- They also might have interesting resources to explore more
- Conversations lead to [[Idea Triggers]] 
- Just like when writing, talking about an idea helps you understand its shape better and think of other related ideas that can connect.
