Based on Andy Matuschak's work. Not building a system that helps knowledge accrete is a fundamental failure of knowledge workers.

- Using [[Evergreen Notes]] helps knowledge work accrete. Promoting wider use of this is a worthy goal even without building additional things. 
- I've noticed increasingly from the process of doing Evergreen notes that working on one note often prompts buried ideas about other notes on topics that are very vaguely related. I think this is because your brain in some way gives extensive "tags" to thoughts/memories and explores all the top thoughts/memories in each of those tags for each thought/memory. This could be simulated by tagging in note-taking systems, but for it to be valuable you would have to spend way too much time exploring all the related tags. It would probably not be worth the time cost. What if, however, we could have AI classify it into tags for you based on the content of the notes, and then each time you visit a note, it can sift thru all the top notes from those tags (with some sort of ranking system to determine the top notes), and it can display them in the periphery. You can decide to dismiss some of them, but some are likely to be helpful.
- Figuring out an efficient system that merges Evergreen notetaking and memory systems to help knowledge fluidly interconnect and grow.
