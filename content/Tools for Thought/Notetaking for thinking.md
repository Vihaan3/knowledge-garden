## Srs-first
I think it would be something like anki but with the ability to write longer things and more text editing options + linking and better graph views. I don’t see why srs and notetaking have to be separate.  Multiple different types of cards (prompts will be like standard flash cards with a question as the question and multiple possible answers as answers that you want to hide until you come up with a new one, while normal will just be a standard obsidian sheet, and maybe others as well). [[Re-inventing the srs system]]

Other features: AI tagging/each note has a relationship with all other notes based on whether they have links to each other, how often you visit one note after visiting the other, etc so that you can support peripheral vision. In that peripheral vision, you should be able to see other linked notes and other triggers that you can decide to set ([[Idea Triggers]]).

The AI chatbot to help support divergent thinking, convergent thinking, help you reason out your ideas, and do deep works question thing. Other ideas in [[Two Types of Thinking]] and [[Why conversations lead to so many good ideas]] (a promising direction for the chatbot is making it feel more like a human conversation where they can provide some criticism, some constructive idea building, some other viewpoints you might not have considered, links to resources that might be interesting to explore more + all of this could happen even without specifically asking it. Maybe from time to time, as it's tuning into what you're saying, it could provide helpful links or insights or tell you where you analysis might seem wrong). **Maybe divergent mode has higher temperature and convergent mode has lower temperature.** Convergent mode should also support the ideation of multiple different types of solutions and approaches and build intricate graph views of how they interconnect. Maybe like a sandbox for ideation/problem-solving where you can build unique graphs and approaches for different problems that live separately extend the ideas from Obsidian canvas and Muse. **Convergent and divergent don't have to only be for finding connections with other notes. It can also affect the temperature at which the AI will suggest other resources to explore and connections between ideas. Divergent will cause it to give your cross-disciplinary directions and ideas from various sources while convergent will be more tightly focused on your current problem/issues. There should also be a slider for going between various stages of convergence and divergence.**

Quick capture, plus maybe the algorithm changes slightly the more you click on/edit a note. Think of more primitives/insight about idea formation and how you can build those in.

## Note-taking First
I think that that treating it as srs first is best, but there's plenty of different ideas even outside of that. Maybe it's primarily a note-taking app, with incremental reminders and basic srs functionality built in so that notes repeat.

In a note-taking first approach, you could have different types of notes (some for ideas, others for fully fleshed notes, others for prompts, etc), and then integrate a lot of those other ideas. 

## Breaking it down into quick tests

- Tagging 
- Something like Linus’s thing makes connections appear out of thin air
- Better srs for life + explore Kawara
	- Linking between prompts 
- AI prompts that can structure thinking in different contexts
- Better capture and potentially differentiation between ideas and other things
