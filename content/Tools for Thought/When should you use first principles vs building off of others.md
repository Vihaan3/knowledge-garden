First Principles argument: You're not derivative, sometimes it's important to shoot yourself in the foot to gain a deeper understanding(https://jacobgw.com/blog/observation/2023/07/08/shoot-yourself-in-the-foot.html), riskier of doing good work but higher chances of doing innovative work

Learning from others argument: More efficient (it's faster to learn from others and make sure that your work isn't just doing what somebody else's already done), maybe derivative is okay if you're expanding, more likely that you can do good work by maybe higher chances???

Actually the adjacent possible argument argues against First Principles indirectly because in order to get to the frontier you need to build off of others. So ig you need to have a good mix of both an ability to build off of others and an ability to constantly question and think critically. This is probably the best way to get the best of both worlds.
