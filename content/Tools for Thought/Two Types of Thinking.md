> Thinking often involves a similar kind of search for better explanations, and applications of those explanations. Creative, “divergent” thinking involves our minds going out and exploring our idea mazes to try to find latent explanations – associations or relationships between previously unrelated ideas that may make our worldview more robust. Solution-seeking, “convergent” thinking involves the reverse – searching for explanations and associations in our minds that fit some problem at hand, so that we can decompose new problems into patterns we recognize how to solve.

I think this is a false dichotomy because divergent thinking and convergent thinking both look for associations and are often the same thing, but I think it could be a good heuristic for developers developing [[Notetaking for thinking]]. 

We should be building tools that can support both as well as possible. **Try to think of failures in either one of these.** 

This corresponds in general with building better search and tools for the mind.
