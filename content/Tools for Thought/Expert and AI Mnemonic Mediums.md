- Have "expert" flashcard makers create cards for pages and use that to train an ai on how to create flashcards -> tie this into the question of does creating the flash card have a sizeable difference. There seems to be a yes in that making your own flashcards aids you in the process of remembering but a no in the fact that most ppl suck at making flashcards.
- Have a bunch of experts/writers of books and blog posts create Quantum Country style things for their books. This can become an online library. 
- **With ai, it would be possible to create flashcards that can quiz you for anything you read. I have a theoretical idea of this all planned out. It's like an extension, and as you read, it will extract and take flashcards (maybe using the system from the idea above). From time to time, it'll pause your scrolling with a popup to answer those questions. When you get something wrong, it can explain it for you and show you the relevant text. You can edit and revise the questions. They then get sent to a thing like orbit that reminds you with emails. Even w/o the expert flashcard thing, this is fully possible (AI summaries are actually pretty decent). Just a lot of work.**
