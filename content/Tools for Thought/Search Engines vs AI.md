As AI models become better, will search engines become obsolete? 

*Clarification: Obviously there's lots of potential in mixing search with AI (and that's where most of the innovation in search has been coming from recently), but I'm talking about whether the idea of a search engine itself will become obsolete.*

I see no real practical reason to use a search engine over AI for information collection (though the web browser is also used to access webapps), but something feels different about using AI to learn about a subject vs. surfing through articles. AI is shorter, somewhat less trustworthy, and you don't exactly know what it's getting from where. However, with AI advances, I think this will change. For pure information collection, in that case, search is probably best. 

**Something interesting to think about: What incentivizes people to post online once people stop looking for search results online? Does this even matter with AI? Especially because most content is junk anyways?**
