## Answer to the question
MN thinks that we have to create practices that can enable memory systems to both become transferable and powerful. I think that the role of transferability is *relatively* low-hanging fruit that can be addressed by better tools and llms creating good flashcards (especially thru [[Expert and AI Mnemonic Mediums]]) that can both reduce the time it takes to get started and the barrier of not creating good flashcards. Enough transferability and some central pushing (**maybe the creation of a definitive document with good rules of thumb and heuristics** or something like the sequences that can help create a central community) could probably engage enough users that there would be some examples of ppl documenting examples of memory systems really working well (like the creator of zettelkasten but for memory systems) that we would be able to showcase its power. This would increase the number of ppl in the culture, which would lead to more power showcases + more demand for creators in the space + more demand for better tools + better crowdsourced culture and so on in an exponential explosion.    

## Community vs Tools 
Michael Nielsen suggests that memory systems might be like surfing, where development of tools contributes less to progress in the field than advancements made by the culture as a whole. I'm not completely sure about this. I think tools have a larger role to play in this field than in something like surfing, maybe it's something like programming? Where tools can help advance the productivity of programmers a lot, but there's a lot to be earned from culture as well. 

There probably won't be major successes in terms of companies and tools until there's a broader culture. It's possible that a major success could expand the culture considerably. Michael Nielsen says that that's unlikely to happen, but I'm not sure. 

All of this thinking helps give me another context from which to think abt **How can I develop a project that helps make the user barrier to entry low, and ensures at a basic level that there is high skilled use?** (In hindsight this sounds familiar. I probably came across it in Andy's notes at some point.)
