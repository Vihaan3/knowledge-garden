- The core ideas behind spaced repetition systems (automated scheduling for something repetitive based on your choices) could and (I believe) should be generalized to other aspects of life (I explore some of these in [[Spaced everything]]).

Pianos seem designed primarily for experts and only incidentally for beginners. If you were designing the piano with modern software design practice in mind it would have 8 white keys, no black keys, and no pedals. It'd be easy to play some simple songs, and that's it. What we're really looking for is ideas which can be the foundation for long-run improvement, with an extraordinarily high ceiling. - [Michael Nielsen](https://michaelnotebook.com/bbms/index.html)
