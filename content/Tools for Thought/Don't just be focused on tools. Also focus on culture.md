From [[How can we make memory systems widespread]]. 

Building/(finding and expanding) a memory system culture and creating better practices in the use of memory systems and note taking so that we can all focus on virtuosity is about as important as building better tools. Finding new ways to push the frontier of the established practices in this field (which is best accomplished by getting as many minds thinking about and using these things as possible) is probably also the best way to think of better ideas as shown in the startup advice from Paul Graham in [[Life Advice for Ambitious Teenagers ]](why haven't I always been taking evergreen notes these old notes are so unwieldly istg).

For that, the work I'm already doing on [[Social Infrastructure]] should apply.
