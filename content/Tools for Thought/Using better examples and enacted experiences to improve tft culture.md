Michael Nielsen suggests in [[How can we make memory systems widespread]] that better cultural practices will benefit the use of memory systems, which I want to generalize to tools for thought in general. 
Promoting the use of fundamental concepts like [[Evergreen Notes]], teaching people [[How to Write Good Prompts]], and even just promoting the idea that spaced repetition systems should be used to learn information outside of just school. Finding and promoting some better ways that [[Evergreen Notes]] and SRS systems should connect to enhance knowledge would be useful as well.

To do this, an interesting idea I have is to use better explanatory mediums to help people understand how to do these things (basically build good [[Enacted Experiences]] that help build intuition and lessen the learning curve). A good example of this is Andy Matuschak's https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGcs4tyey18.
