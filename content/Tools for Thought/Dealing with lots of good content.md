This is an extension of [[Making Massive Input Better]]

**There's tons of good content out there to read. How can I prioritize and identify which ones are the best, which ones aren't so good, etc within one tool.** Readwise, Instapaper, and Pocket don't feel good enough. 

I think this kind of thing needs to have some spaced system (can't find the original link by Andy), where something you think you want to read soon has short timelines and something you think you want to read later has longer timelines/repetitions. You can also choose the first day you want it to repeat. Also keying into the playlist idea (linked in the original link by Andy), articles you've read that you like could be repeated on time scales. The more you like it, the more often it will repeat. 

**You definitely also need to have some form of summary similar to what Linus built.** 

Some way this could work is maybe adding an extension to Pocket if that's allowed
