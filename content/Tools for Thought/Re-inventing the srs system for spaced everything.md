It would probably have a different scheduling algorithm and you can suggest the first day you want it to repeat and what time interval (long, short, medium) and thereâ€™s a default one otherwise.

Also maybe some options for timelines that collapse inward (start on long time frames that progressively get shorter). There are probably some defaults for standard use cases as described in [[Re-inventing the srs system]].
