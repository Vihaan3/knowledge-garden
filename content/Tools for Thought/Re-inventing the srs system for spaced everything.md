[[Spaced everything]]
It would probably have a different scheduling algorithm and you can suggest the first day you want it to repeat and what time interval (long, short, medium) and thereâ€™s a default one otherwise.

Also maybe some options for timelines that collapse inward (start on long time frames that progressively get shorter). There are probably some defaults for standard use cases as described in [[Building a better memory system]].

A key question: should I build design off of deck-first hierarchies or tag-first hierarchies? Deck-first is good in that you train yourself to think different in different decks i.e. slower and deeper for idea-style decks and learning decks vs quick check-off style mentality in task and habit decks. Tag-first is good is more fluid. I can also just implement functionality for both (though that's more difficult).
### Some shortcomings with traditional srs for specific other use cases

- Ideas
	- There needs to be an easy way to put a limit to the amount of cards you can have in a day. 
- Writing
	- Formatting in anki is annoying.
- Certain types of tasks
	- As mentioned, you should be able to set the first day that you want the task to appear.
- Habit tracking 
	- Habits should probably pop up every day for the first few days, every 2 days for a bit after that, and gradually increase.
- Reading inbox
	- More customizability for what day you want it to repeat. Probably after the 3-4 options that show up at the bottom, there's an input box for how many days you want it to repeat in. 
	- After you review a deck, there should be an option to add it to the deck for today that you can review later.

For certain types of decks there should also be a minimum number of cards in a day (i.e. maybe you want to read at least 2 things from your reading inbox every day.)
