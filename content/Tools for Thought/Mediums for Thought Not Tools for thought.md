## Intro
Even the wording of this community has promoted a focus on building tools. But we shouldn't be stopping at tools. We should be building mediums. Tools tend to be small and specific changes to broader workflows. Mediums redefine and expand the way we can think and work. 

In general, mediums are composed of fundamental building blocks that redefine the way you work. Notion, Google docs, Microsoft Excel, Figma are all like this. They are composed of building blocks to support a powerful workflow. This is why notion is the most successful of the new knowledge management startups. It's all based off of the central concept of blocks and databases.

This is why [[End-user programming]] is such a powerful idea, and many of the recently popular tools have been taking this idea more and more seriously.

**Important to note that:** [[The best mediums for thought will live outside any particular apps]]
