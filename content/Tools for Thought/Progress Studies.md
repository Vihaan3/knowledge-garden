Super important to study progress itself, and how insights happen. This can help me understand better ways to build a community with syngenious and with my tft research. **I want to build the next Bell Labs/the next Silicon Valley but online. How can that happen?** (While also keeping things fun. This is probably another question to ask while building social infrastructure. What's the focus on inspiring innovation and building and entrepreneurship and excellence vs just providing a community and which is preferable?)

- throughout history, relatively small geographic pockets have been centers for progress
	- Rome, Greece, China, Middle East, Italy, England, Silicon Valley
- The above shows that some ecosystems can be better at generating progress than others. But what do they have in common?
	- "But what do they have in common? Just how productive can a cultural ecosystem be? Why did Silicon Valley happen in California rather than Japan or Boston? Why was early-20th-century science in Germany and Central Europe so strong? Can we deliberately engineer the conditions most hospitable to this kind of advancement or effectively tweak the systems that surround us today?" Bell Labs
	- "Â how we should identify and train brilliant young people, how the most effective small groups exchange and share ideas, which incentives should exist for all sorts of participants in innovative ecosystems (including scientists, entrepreneurs, managers, and engineers), how much different organizations differ in productivity (and the drivers of those differences), how scientists should be selected and funded"
	- Although there's plenty of research answering sub-parts of these questions, they're all answered in different fields and thinkers in these disciplines aren't working together to solve the problem of progress.
