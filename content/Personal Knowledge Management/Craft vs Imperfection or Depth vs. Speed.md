I want to be a craftsman with my writing like Julian Shapiro, and invest a lot of time in making each article perfect.

At the same time, maybe the best way to get better is through lots of iteration and imperfection like [[Atomic Habits]]'s pot analogy. However, with that, the thing is that there were very good and very short feedback loop; how good the pot looked. I'm not sure that feedback loops in writing are as good because few commenters will comment on how technically good your writing is, and even if they do, you're unlikely to get those commentors for a while until you grow. So now, maybe I'm going to err towards craft and improving my writing craft to its utmost.
