## Definition
Social infrastructure is everything that connects our communities together.  We've both converged on the fact that a key goal should be promoting [[Agency]] as subtly as possible during [[2-18-2024 Logan]].
## Major Questions
- What's the focus on inspiring innovation and building and entrepreneurship and excellence vs just providing a community and which is preferable? Basically define roughly what you think this social infrastructure should be. This should vaguely affect your search.
- How does one engineer culture.
- Can I use something like the Non-trivial club idea? (I think it actually provides a solid model for both community and impact). But bigger?
- How hands off should we be?
- How many ppl can we hope to realistically affect?
## Logan 
[[Logan Graves]] wants to build social infrastructure for "sparkly" people. He wants to have sparkly people act as force multipliers on each other, and provide a sense of community and direction to sparkly by lost people. 

His proposed system of doing this:
1. **Build an online community with sparkly people.** Currently working on this.
2. **Work with cool people from that community and start chapters of a federated club in their local areas.** (sorta like NHS; an exiting proof-of-concept federation/community is [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/))
3. **Leverage local connections, existing networks, etc. to promote/recruit for that club in various cities.** (Part of the question is "what do we do with the people once we found them"; some ideas include competitions, essay contests, speaker events, participant-run lectures/workshops on interesting subjects, and facilitated 1-on-1s, networking events, group skill-up sessions, etc.)
4. **Scale.** Get charitable funding, scale up, maybe hire people to actually support the org.
5. **Become "how things are."** This is the end goal: make it _feel really normal_ to have easy access to sparkly people and resources as a high school, middle school, college student. Just like how school sports, band, Model UN, etc. is a "thing people do in high school," the goal is for whatever this organization becomes to be _a fact of life._ This is how we know we have succeeded.

## Andy Matuschak
Andy's work on things like developing enabling environments and enacted experiences is important, as *I think* these things are what you need to build a successful sparkly community.

[[Organizational Culture]] is key to this. So is building a good [[Enabling Environments]] and thinking abt ways to incorporate [[Enacted Experiences]] so that ppl actually end up learning the value of the things we teach them. Also, learning [[How to Build a Movement]]. Also [[Progress Studies]]!!!! 


## Real World Examples

### Hack Club
Hack club is an example of something like this that's done pretty well. This is probably the upper bounds of the success we could hope to achieve (because of the fact that more rich people relate to being struggling young programmers than of being alone sparkly ppl).

What's made Hack Club so awesome is the team's dedication to building cool stuff for teenagers to rally around. **Similarly, we could have cool projects like a wiki, a library, a grid-recurse thing, a skill-exchange platform, a knowledge-transfer platform, etc.** 

However, I don't think they've done a particularly good job of crafting general culture on a mass scale, probably because they're so hands-off. They've done very well in creating awesome projects and things, and getting the sparkliest teenagers to rally around it. From the lens of finding sparkly people, this approach is the one where you reach out to as many people as possible and hope that the top 2-3% are sparkly and can serve as force maximizers on each other. 

All of this begs the question: **How many ppl can we realistically hope to actually deeply affect?**
### Buildspace
Buildspace is a community that took its idea of shipping to the max and created a culture around that. The design and layout of their website, the fact that they have anime music videos, has all built a chill builder culture. They don't run after you, but they help you as much as possible. **I think helping sparkly teens do the same (providing a strong building/shipping culture) should be part of this social infrastructure. This is a large part of what will build a culture of agency.** 
### Y Combinator
No idea. Research

### Bell Labs
No idea. Research.

## What I Think
A thing to keep in mind is **not to fall into the rat or ea trap too much. This shouldn't be centered on a specific community, which is really easy to do when you have starter funding from a specific org.** 

I think Logan's method is pretty good. My only thing is **how do we create an activity for them?** Logan also asked that question, but I think it's actually one of the most important ones. I think I agree with Andy Matuschak on [[Enabling Environments]] in that we can't create one just for the sake of being one. I'm not completely sure that it has to swing so hard the other way, but the doing definitely has to be at least 50% of it. 

So, now the main questions are:
- What's the activity?
- How does one engineer culture?
- How hands off should we be?
- How many ppl can we hope to realistically affect?
- How the hell do we get started?
- How do you build culture while not creating homogeneity? Is it even possible?
