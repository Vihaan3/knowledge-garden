The reason it always feels like something's going wrong/everything that can possibly go wrong is going wrong, and nothing is ever always going right is because of entropy. Entropy: a scientific principle about gradual decay and disorder/randomness. James Clear argues that both apply to real life. There are infinitely many possible variations of everything in life, but only a few are "good". And slowly but surely, everything will decay. Big businesses will decline, you'll grow old, you're friends will stop talking to you as much, you'll lose touch with your family, etc. It takes effort to fight decay and improve against it; nothing will improve by itself, and in fact, it will almost always de-improve.

A way to fight this is to always take responsibility for your actions a la [[The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fck]]
