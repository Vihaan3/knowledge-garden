I don't know why, but I feel suspicious of anyone that doesn't say "I don't know" often. There are definitely valid reasons (they might never engage in conversations that they don't know about), but in the general case most ppl just make up plausible-sounding random stuff when talking about things. I know this, because I used to do this. A lot. I think I've gotten a lot better at this over time, but yeah I definitely do this, so I like ppl who don't.
