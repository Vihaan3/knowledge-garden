## Randos on the internet

Derek Sivers: Slow, patient, mastery in everything he does in life. He's a slow and deep thinker and doer, which is what I aspire to be. 
Cal Newport: Similar to Derek Sivers in many ways.
James Clear: Master on habits and a bunch of other random topics. Good writer.
Gwern Branwen: Clearly has a boundless curiosity and is a very good writer. The amount of ideas he generates is amazing.
Andy Matuschak: The amount of insight that is in his notes is amazing. If he wanted to be a full time online writer like most of these other people are, I have no doubt he would be one of the most successful.
Michael Nielsen: Great writer, awesome insights. I especially love his Augmenting Long Term memory post.
Paul Graham: Great writer, great programmer, great builder. Has tons of advice in all of those fields and more.
Julian Shapiro: Someone who clearly takes pride in being as good of a writer as he can. You can see it in the amount of research and the clarity of his writing. 
Patrick Collinson: Awesome from teenage to later.
Zach Latta: Really poured his heart into creating an awesome community, and he was surprisingly super successful.
