- A lot of the fallacy in negotiations occur when you assume humans are rational. You have to learn how to affect the irrational System 1 to get the System 2 to do what you want.
- "It all starts with the universally applicable premise that people want to be understood and accepted. Listening is the cheapest, yet most effective concession we can make to get there"
- "Negotiation serves two distinct, vital life functions-information gathering and behavior influencing"
- In mirroring, repeat what they've said to get them off balance.
- Use labeling: when you label their emotions to try to get somewhere
	- Label your counterpart's emotions and mirror their behavior 
	- Use accusation audits
		- Label what they'll say abt you beforehand
- No isn't bad. No helps you get negotiations started. A no that helps you progress to real solutions is better than a fake yes to get you to back off
- The two words that immediately transform any negotiation: "that's right"
- How to gain mentors - make them invested in your success
- Bend your counterpart's reality
	- don't split the difference meeting halfway often leads to bad deals for both sides
	- use extreme offers to anchor your counterpart's reality
	- use odd numbers to make your final results seem more real
	- "People will take more risks to avoid a loss than to realize a gain. Make sure your counterpart sees that there is something to lose by inaction."
- Make your opponent feel the illusion of control
- Guarantee execution by using calibrated questions: "what should we do if the deal falls through? how do you expect me to do this?"
- Find the black swans: the underlying secrets that would completely change the negotiation if they were known
