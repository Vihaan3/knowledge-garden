This is a [[Mental Models]] that asks: What is the most efficient way to solve a problem if you started from scratch? If you look past humanity's attempts to solve it, what is the best approach if you reasoned from its fundamental principles.

This is extremely important if you want to have impact in any sort of way as a startup founder ([[How to Get Startup Ideas]]), blogger, researcher, or general knowledge worker (because [[Contrarian Thinking]] is a major role in most ppl's success).

Andy Matuschak seems to be especially good at this. I think an important part of being able to reason from first principles is simply not consuming/thoughtfully and critically consuming all the information you see before immediately agreeing with it. This is something I think I fall into often, and something that slower reading, [[Evergreen Notes]], and [[Careful Thinking]] is enabling me to do.
