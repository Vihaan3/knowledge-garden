- On rest: the common culture is that you do your work and then you “rest”. There’s this view that rest is the best state, and the ground state. But our definitions of rest aren’t really rest. Watching tv, scrolling social media, etc isn’t really rest. It’s more activity. Because rest is boring. The true state of rest is not the ground goal to be reached everyday. Rest is not something to be achieved as a reward for completing work. Rest is just another part of what your body needs. Deep influence from replacing guilt.
- Too many ppl feel guilty abt a certain task (binging, scrolling, etc), and then they continue to do it the next day, and feel guilty again. Guilt only helps when it stops you from doing it. If you continue doing something over and over again, it’s a failure caused by your system, so change the system. Delete the app, block the website, cancel the subscription, put away the remote.. :Replacing guilt
