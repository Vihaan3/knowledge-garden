There's two types of focus. 

## Short Term Focus
The ability to do [[Deep Work]]. This is really hard to cultivate, and takes a lot of time and skill (and can easily go away with just a few distracting habits).  

## Long Term Focus
The ability to focus on larger aspects of your life. What your goals are, what projects you want to pursue, what interests you have.

Short term focus is hard. But long-term focus is harder. And it's what you need to succeed at life. There's a weird reason for this. There's linear returns to every extra minute you spend on a problem, **but there's a big jump up at a certain point.** Lots of random ideas and insights originate past a certain point of obsession on a particular topic. You improve faster. You learn quicker. There's fewer switching costs in terms of your attention. 

I still don't know an effective way to do it. I think a good rule of thumb is probably that you can only have about 5 goals at one time (ofc this depends on how big/time-consuming your goals are). A better way to think about it would probably be just breaking down into time. Ideally, you should have even less. If I wasn't in school, I would probably be able to keep just 5-6 goals, and really stick with them, but alas I have to deal with school.
