Experiencing doing [[Evergreen Notes]] and [[Slower Consumption]] over [[2-12 to 2-18]] as described in [[2-18-2024 Logan]] has shown me the value of carefully digesting all of the main content I read and thinking good notes at the same time as reading it. This leads to deeper thinking and higher understanding. It also generally leads to more intellectual engagement with the text, and I often add my own insights and am able to think thru the stuff as I write about it. These are a bunch of the experiences that andy matuschak said I would experience, but I didn't really believe him for about a week, and just tried randomly for fun a week ago. This shows the incredible value of [[Enacted Experiences]].
