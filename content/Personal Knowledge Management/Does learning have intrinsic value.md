Is learning intrinsically meaningful even if you have no expectation of ever using that knowledge?

### Favor
- You need to learn to build more accurate mental models of the world; learning expands your territory
- You don't know what might be useful later on, and knowing a lot about the world probably increases the surface area of serendipity
### Against
- Every minute you spend learning is a minute you spend not doing
