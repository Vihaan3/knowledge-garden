## Note Taking Secrets of the Top 1%: CK

Don’t make a wall of text, process information in your head and understand it before writing down concise things and things you don’t understand

  

## The Ultimate Mind Map Tutorial: CK

  

T: Thought-process: understand the topic properly and in depth first in your head before you make your notes. Make sure your mind map illustrates your thought processes clearly.

R: Relationships: fully illustrate the relationships between topics.

E: Express: Use analogies, metaphors, pictures for things you don’t understand.

  

## The STIC Framework: Ali Abdaal

S: Spacing

T: Testing

I: Interleaving: Mixing problems up or studying up between topics instead of doing 5 of this 5 of this 5 of this

C: Categorization: categorize into a tree of knowledge -> useful for mind mapping

  

## Retrospective Revision Timetables: Ali Abdaal

Retrospective studying = making a list of all topics → choosing your hardest/the topic you’re worst at every day → doing active recall → putting dates of each day done into google sheet → color code (red, yellow, green) by how well you did in the active recall → repeat until all topics are green

## Active Recall: Ali Abdaal

Ways to use active recall:

1. Anki: Web flash cards are free
    
2. Write notes with the book closed
    
3. Use spider diagrams
    

Spaced Repetition:

1. Try to fill out as many blocks as you can every day rather than trying to do as many as you can well (interleaving)
    

## 12 Ways to Active Recall: Cajun Koi Academy

PRIOR TO CLASS 2 Stop and Recite: When being exposed to learning material for the first time, -> stop after every section/idea/concept/process -> close book/pause video -> recite what you have just learned in own words -> the more explicit you are by writing, typing or saying the better

DURING CLASS 3 Write in-class questions: -> for definitions and facts use What is … ? questions. -> for processes/method/procedures/ techniques use How? questions. -> use Why? questions for deeper understanding -> answer the lecture objectives/review questions

→ Separate every page with a divider line the night before (or in between class times)

- On one side of the divider line write notes, on the other side write questions → fold paper as you put the questions into notion the next day and try to visualize and answer as you type them in. The ones that are harder, highlight
    

AFTER CLASS

4 Immediately review your in class questions after class

6 use mindmaps -> blank piece of paper -> pick a topic of study -> brain dump everything you know about the topic -> actively link ideas to one another

7 Teaching ( feynman technique/ protege effect) -> do a brain splurge of all the concepts that you have learned from memory by writing it out or teaching it in own words -> type as if its a script, forces you to choose your words carefully -> pretend teaching to a 7 year old ( use as little jargon as possible) -> pretend to teach an outsider -> pretend to teach a nosy friend ( keep answering “why” repeatedly)

ETERNAL MEMORY 8 Digital Flashcards!! -> remnote, supermemo, anki -> interleaving -> spaced repetition -> premade decks

9 Enumeration -> particularly useful for process and problem based classes -> list of steps to execute in particular order

10 Occlusion -> images, structures, graphs, charts, anatomy, surgery -> image occlusion functions in SRS -> alternative use word doc and cover answer with shape, delete to reveal -> cloze deletions for words in sentences

HOME STRETCH 11 Problem sets -> make sure they come with answers and explanations -> understand why wrong answers are wrong and why right answers are right

1. practice tests -> mimic test conditions as much as possible -> timing, bathroom breaks, earplugs, mask etc… -> gauge which topics are strengths and which are weaknesses
    

Me:

- Drawing spider diagrams and mind maps to understand concepts.
    
- Covering notes and restating in own words.
    
- Making questions as you take notes and putting them on a google doc in bold by default. Every time you get one right, make it unbold, and everytime you get it wrong make it bold.
    
- Or put it into a notion db for each class and move it up and down understanding levels by kanban boards.
    
- Or put it into a notion page with toggles and mark all completed ones by color based on stage of completion
