Most of the value in the world is about contrarian thinking about the future from [[Life Advice for Ambitious Teenagers]]. Mark Manson agrees with this as well, that one of the best ways to have success is through having contrarian ideas. 

This is something that takes time and effort, but it's intensely valuable. Here are some ways to do this, I think.

- Think from [[First Principles]] 
- Try not to follow the trends that everyone does ("If you read what everyone else reads, you think like everyone else thinks")
- Constantly question everything about life. This will make life somewhat less comfortable and easy to navigate, but it's the best way to develop contrarian ideas.

Of course, there's good reasons that most trends exist. Most of your contrarian ideas will be wrong. But you only have to be right a few times.
