I think a good analogy is basically he was a powerful optimizer that was misaligned. He maximized the amount of money he had going up at the sake of everything else, and he was good at it. He also had other issues like believing basically everyone else was stupid and the belief that he could basically do whatever he wanted to do. 

**Also there's an interesting idea here that minimizing suffering might be the wrong goal in EA.** I think that's a very valid opinion. In general, EAs seem to fail when they stretch the rational, logical, mathematical underpinnings of EA way too far. Literally there were some ppl who believed the only value of them having kids was if 1. the kid turned out to be an insane EA or 2. It helped them be better EAs. The most severe and deluded EAs are the ones who try to kill their own feelings for the sake of "doing good". A good point, here, though is that at least they're trying. Even if they're massively wrong, the fact that they're trying is more than you can say for most others.
