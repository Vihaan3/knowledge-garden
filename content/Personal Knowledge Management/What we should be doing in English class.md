A lot of the time we spend in English is wasteful, and building skills that I honestly don't think really matter. Even in academia, I won't be using the writing methods that my English teachers expect from me. I have a suspicion that most of those methods (introduction, 3 body paragraphs, conclusion) were just standardized to make it easier to grade (or that might be a major factor why). 

What we should be learning (some of this is taught somewhat, but the focus should be increased)
- Be able to critically analyze other writing
	- This is probably the only thing we do somewhat well
- Learn [[How to make ideas spread]]
	- Learn and practice [[How to Write Better]]
	- Learn and practice [[How to be a great storyteller]]
	- Learn and practice [[How to Build a Movement]]
	- All of this will probably happen as a result of weekly/bi-weekly blog post style work + weekly/bi-weekly speeches, talks, presentations, etc. The topics for these things can be anything from the common list of objectives and themes in [[How to Write Better]]. Constantly having to think of places of friction in the world is also a way to train us to be better thinkers about the world. [[How to train yourself to think a certain way]]
	- It could be argued that we already do some of this, but it's all as parts of elaborate projects and papers that take up lots of time. In this case, I'm heavily towards the craft side of the scale: [[Craft vs Imperfection or Depth vs. Speed]]
- Debating and Changing your mind
	- Probably a lot of the ideas from rationality here
		- How to change your mind/ensure that you always maintain an open-mind
		- How to respectfully place your opinions
	- Some parts of [[How to make good predictions]] when it comes to thinking and updating
		- [[Against Learning from Dramatic Events]]
	- Some parts of [[Negotiation]]
- Developing content consumption practices
	- Diverse sources
	- Note-taking practices
		- [[Evergreen Notes]]
	- Memorization practices potentially
