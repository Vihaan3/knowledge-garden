*I don't think I'm doing a lot of these ideas justice. If you want to learn more about any of them or want to collaborate, reach out. If these projects spark any ideas for you, feel free to work on those ideas by yourself if you'd like!  (Please reach out and let me know.) I'm too excited about all of these ideas to claim any sort of ownership over them, and I'd love to see them done well.*

### Now
- A [spaced repetition inbox](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zUP4GuzPF33dWkZPiu9N6V5) in Obsidian.        
- A de-addiction app that takes inspiration from [Ana](https://github.com/UlisseMini/ana).
- Learning a little bit about [[How to Get Startup Ideas]], [[How to (tech) Startup]], [[How to generate more good ideas]], and [[How to train yourself to think a certain way]].
- Understanding how to [[How to make ideas spread]], [[Organizational Culture]], [[How to Build a Movement]].
- A few [[Social Infrastructure]] projects at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) to make the community slightly more cohesive
### Very near future
- Learning more about AI
	1. To understand if I might want to pursue a career in [alignment](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5rsa37pBjo4Cf9fkE/a-newcomer-s-guide-to-the-technical-ai-safety-field)
	2. For use in my tools for thought projects 
- [[Re-inventing the srs system for spaced everything]].
	-  A true [OS-level spaced repetition system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zNLoqjEVe5dheMKmTTyB9E3) Alexander Obenauer has created [an exciting prototype](https://alexanderobenauer.com/ollos/) that's somewhat similar to what I was envisioning. 
- [[Notetaking for thinking]]: scroll down for quick tests. (Sorry if this note isn't cleaned up by the time you read this; this was a collection of many of my scratch thoughts as this idea developed.)
- A flashcard chrome extension that turns any text into a [mnemonic medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zKPv6qkSErdRGqyryvgS2wS) like [Quantum Country](https://quantum.country/).

### (Slightly) More distant future
- A definitive project for [hack club](https://hackclub.com/) that can transform the capabilities and lives of all hack clubbers.
- Something like [DK](https://medium.com/@NirZicherman/the-ideal-social-network-5e79ebdbfe7c) (most likely a prototype for fun so that I can improve my design skills). Maybe for Hack Club?
- A better read-it-later + downtime application that uses spaced repetition scheduling. Basically [Sofa](https://www.sofahq.com/) + [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) + spaced repetition.
