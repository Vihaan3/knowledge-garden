Writers of pop science books or even just plain self help books, creators of courses, and other ppl like that have an incentive to make hard things seem easier than they are. If they don't, ppl will be turned off and their products won't be as reliable. I'm not sure if it's possible to fix this, maybe changing the incentive structure for content creators?
