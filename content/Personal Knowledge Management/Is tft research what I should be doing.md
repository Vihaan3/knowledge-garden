## Pro 
- It's fun
- I think it helps people at least a little bit
## Con
- AI is probably the ultimate tool for thought, and a lot of this work will probably be meaningless once AI comes around
- In as much as I value helping people, I could be doing "higher value" things 
	- Sometimes it feels like my rationale that I'm helping the world become more creative and generate better ideas for the common good seem like an attempt to rationalize what's basically just a bunch of nerd projects that have little chance of impact
