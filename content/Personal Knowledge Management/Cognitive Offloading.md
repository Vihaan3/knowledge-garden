The Internet is good but also we really on it too much to quickly look up facts and stuff->becoming too dependent on it as a cheat sheet and losing our ability and desire to critically think

Solution: Codify a time of how long to work/think about a problem before going to the internet. The 15-minute rule: for all problems that apply, spend 15 minutes struggling with it yourself and write down the different approaches you're using. After 15 minutes use the internet.

  

Me: Set a reasonable time limit for whatever problem. This could be 5 minutes, 15 minutes, an hour, two days, or anything. Practice more intense [[Deep Work]]
