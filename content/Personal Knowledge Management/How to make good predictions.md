- Not being overconfident 
- Using base rates and percentages as a starting point before considering the specifics
- Being willing to constantly update as you take in new information
- Using inversion (from "Is it a good time to do a capital raise?" to "Is it a bad time to do a capital raise?") [[Inversion]]

- [ ] **Start an open book/post of predictions which a short description of why you made those predictions. For any specific predictions that you like, go in-depth and give an in-depth summary.** This will only happen once you spend a while making predictions for a bunch of different topics.

## Superforecasting
- Only give your system 1 credence if you've had the opportunity to train your pattern matching based on cues. Even then, you should double-check rigorously
- Many forecasts aren't really forecasts. "Some chance", "high chance", "high impact". We need probabilities and clear wording. 
- Be both an information aggregator and a perspective aggregator (the second is for games where you have to beat the crowd)
- Just because a forecast was wrong doesn't mean that it was unreasonable or a bad prediction. This is because it's hard to answer "was it reasonable" so we replace it with "was it correct"
- Take the outside view and then the inside view. Be self-critical and consult + think from several perspectives
- Probabilistic thinking is opposed w/ it was meant to happen ideology. Non fate-based thinking is correlated w/ higher forecasting scores
- Mini-handbook halfway through
	- Unpack the question into components 
	- Distinguish as sharply as you can between the known and unknown and leave no assumption unscrutinized
	- Adopt the outside view and put the problem into a comparative perspective that downplays its uniqueness and treats it as a special case of a wider class of phenomena.
	- Then adopt the inside view that plays up the uniqueness of the problem
	- Also explore the similarities and differences between your views and those of others-- and pay special attention to prediction markets and other methods of extracting wisdom from crowds. 
	- Synthesize all these different views into a single vision as acute as that of a dragonfly.
	- Express your judgement as precisely as you can, using a finely grained scale of probability
- When should you update in response to new information?
	- You have to carefully manage between overreaction and underreaction.
	- For this, do many small updates instead of many large updates or a few small ones
- P (H | D)/P(-H | D) = P (D | H) x P (D | -H) X P(H)/P(-H): Posterior Odds = Likelihood Ratios x Prior Odds
- None of this should be set in stone "rather break the rules than make a barbarous forecast"
- **What superforecasters tend to be:**
	- Philosophy
		- Cautious: Nothing is certain
		- Humble: Reality is infinitely complex
		- Nondeterministic: What happens is not meant to be and does not have to happen
	- Thinking styles
		- Actively open-minded
		- Intelligent and knowledgeable
		- Reflective 
		- Numerate
	- Methods of forecasting
		- Pragmatic
		- Analytic
		- Dragonfly-eyed
		- Probabilistic
		- Thoughtful Updaters
		- Good Intuitive Psychologists
	- Work Ethic
		- Growth Mindset
		- Grit
- As a leader, you have to learn how to balance boldness and decisiveness w/ thinking and forecasting. you should build a culture of criticism, and tell ppl what you want them to do and let them figure out how
- How should you combine the humility you need to be a forecaster w/ the confidence you need to be a leader? Have intellectual humility for the game, but no necessarily humility about your abilities
- Future steps for forecasting
	- symbiosis between superquestioners and superforecasters
		- Potential research questions that Phil Tetlock is pursuing: breaking down complex and big-picture questions into question clusters that can aggregate to provide insight into the big-picture questions
	- more public accountability of forecasters
- It's easy to fall into the trap of learning too much from one's success aka [[Against Learning from Dramatic Events]]

	5. Look for the clashing causal forces at work
	6. Distinguish between as many degrees of uncertainty as necessary
	7. Strike the right balance between under and over confidence
	8. Look for the errors behind your mistakes
	9. Bring out the best in others
	10. Master deep, deliberative practice
