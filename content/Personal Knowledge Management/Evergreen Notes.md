I need to work on writing better Evergreen notes. Rn, my notes are mostly grouped by source instead of topic, which is pretty bad. Andy's notes are clear, concise, have atomic topics, and are densely linked so that ideas naturally connect to one another. From now on, whatever notes I have should gradually become more and more Evergreen. I've already begun work on this by linking more of my notes together and revising a lot of them to be more atomic and more topic-oriented.

### Update 2-20 and 2-19
Atp, the practice of putting down new thoughts into evergreen notes has programmed my brain. I don't think I'm thinking that many more original thoughts, but I am definitely more likely to notice them, write them down, and flesh them out. In the process of fleshing them out, I think of other ideas, and update other evergreen notes. I'm increasingly starting to notice that evergreen notes are [[Serendipity Maximizers]] for training your brain to notice the best ideas. [[Evergreen notes create a map of your thoughts]]
