I really like writing Evergreen Notes because [[Evergreen notes create a map of your thoughts]], which makes them [[Serendipity Maximizers]], [[Serendipitous Idea-Formation]]. They also seem like the best for pushing the frontiers of your thought forward.

## Basic Evergreen Note Philosophy
- Evergreen notes are atomic
- Evergreen notes are densely linked
- You gradually fill the notes out over time: [[Incremental Thinking]]

I'm not sure about this, but I think that [[Evergreen Notes should mainly be used for frontier thoughts]], and that's what I've been doing so far.
