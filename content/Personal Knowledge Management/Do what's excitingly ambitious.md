Recently, I've been plagued by scheduling issues. There's so many exciting things that I could be doing and learning, and it's hard to prioritize. What typically ends up happening is that I spread myself too thin and prevent myself from going too deep into any one thing. I think this philosophy of "do what's excitingly ambitious" could be my solution to longer-scale [[Focus]]. [[You can't do everything]], but I think living this way will automatically make sure you do the things that you care most about doing.

I think it will 
- Lead to a more accomplished life
- Lead to a fulfilled life
- Be less stressful

It's also probably the best answer to [[How to generate more good ideas]] and [[How to Get Startup Ideas]].
