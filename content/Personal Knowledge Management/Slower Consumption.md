It's super valuable to take good notes on and ankify everything important you read (or at least take notes on it.) Taking good notes will make reading everything much longer than you think, but taking notes while reading at the same time automatically leads to not skimming and reading each line carefully and thoughfully and having my own ideas about them. I think I need to keep doing what I told Logan I do: [[2-18-2024 Logan]], which is reading thru things uncarefully most of the time, but saving all the important stuff in pocket, and going thru my pocket in-depth every friday or something. Then on friday, read thru all of the interesting ones, delete the ones that you aren't interested in, and move the interesting things you couldn't get to for the next week. 

Learning to let go of things is something I really need to work on. If you want to consume deeply and actually gain value, you can't consume everything interesting. 

An interesting consideration: [[Massive Input vs Slower Consumption]]
