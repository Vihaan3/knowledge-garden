What are mental models?
- Help you assess how systems work
- Help you make better decisions

# Assessing Systems

"A mental model of a system is a reduction of how it works"

## First Principles
SpaceX. 

What is the most efficient way to solve a problem if you started from scratch? If you look past humanity's attempts to solve it, what is the best approach if you reasoned from its fundamental principles.

How to use first principles for a project:
1. What system underlies this project?
2. Is the system maximally efficient?
3. If not, what are the ironclad principles underlying it?
4. Can I start over from those principles to identify a better way to design this system?

Me: You can use this for a lot of the work that you do. Are you just doing the conventional things, are you doing something new and more efficient?

## One Level Higher

Repeatedly ask if you're optimizing a cog in the machine rather than the machine itself. The higher the level that you optimize at, the greater the ROI. Always go higher and higher and higher until you don't think you can anymore.

# How to Make Decisions

Every decision you make is either a decision about prioritization or allocation:
- Prioritizing: Which path is the best to take?
- Allocating: How much attention should be spent of this?

> **Regret Minimization** — To maximize your long-term happiness, prioritize projects you’d most regret not having pursued by the time you’re old and looking back at your life.

> **Pareto Principle** — 80% of your output will come from the top 20% of your inputs. To maximize ROI, preferentially invest in the 20%.

# Helpful mental models to use

## Optimizing Systems

Chain of models to optimize systems.

1. **One Level Higher**: Find the highest level to optimize at
2. **Theory of Constraints**: At any time, only a few of a system's inputs are constraining the other inputs from producing a greater total output. To continuously increase output, iteratively identify and address the current biggest constraint.
3. **First Principles**: If making improvements using the Theory of Constraints doesn't work, break everything down and rebuild. 

## Making Decisions

Chain of systems to optimize decision-making.
1. **Long term: Regret Minimization**
2. **Medium-Term: Pareto's Principle**
3. **Short-Term: ICE**: When facing many options needing prioritization, score each on three variables using a scale of 1-10: 
	- Impact
	- Confidence
	- Easy (how easy is this option)
