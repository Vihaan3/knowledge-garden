When you try to try, you're expecting failure. You're just sitting around looking like you're doing work for the minimum amount of time that you have to while saving face. Stop trying to try. Just go ahead and do it. Break down your goals into the mini-tasks and dive into the stream. 

You're not trying to cure cancer. You're getting a phd in biology so that you can pursue ground-breaking research.

You're not trying to solve this math problem. You're testing this approach, and if it fails, you have a few other approaches to test in your back pocket. 

You're not trying to create tools for thought. You're thinking of new ideas, testing solutions on people, doing research, etc.
