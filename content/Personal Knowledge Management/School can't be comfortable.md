If [[You can't be comfortable]], if you want to learn effectively and [[There is no speed limit]] other than a self-imposed one, than school is pretty bad for learning. Mostly because most high-achieving kids in school are completely in it for the grades, and they'll complain at anything that has the possibility of bringing their oh-so-perfect 100 down the tiniest bit.

### An ideal school structure that prioritizes life-long learning, should probably have these qualities:
- Only pop assessments, and these assessments should actually test your learning instead of being simple pattern-matching. Probably little to no multiple choice
	- Use of memory systems (especially srs) should probably become standard to make this low-stress
- homework that's difficult and actually pushes you to apply and expand on what you've learned in class
	- no fake class work and home work that doesn't actually teach you anything and is merely meant to keep you busy
- Popcorn calling instead of voluntary participation
- This: [[What we should be doing in English class]]
- Faster pace with the resources and scaffolding to learn outside of class if you fall behind
- Gym should actually push you to become stronger, more athletic, and healthier all around
- Somehow develop a general student culture that values intellectual curiosity
- To accommodate for all of this there should be:
	- Greater autonomy in choosing what classes you want to take so that you only learn what you genuinely want to learn
	- A different grading system somehow that reflects the rigor
		- Notes on the word "rigor" -> most "rigorous" schools/programs just give more busywork than other ones instead of actually being more intellectually rigorous. There's no value in hard work for the sake of hard work.

It's weird to write this because I know that up to a few months ago I would've detested a school like this.
