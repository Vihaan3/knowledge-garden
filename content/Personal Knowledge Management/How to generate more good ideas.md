## Notes

- From [[How to Get Startup Ideas]] and https://paulgraham.com/getideas.html
- **Broad introduction**: I can't know for sure because this topic is pretty ill-researched but from some people that I respect and assign credence to, you need to notice anomalies. You can do this in everyday life, and by getting to the frontiers knowledge on a subject you're passionate about so that you can discover what's missing. A lot of the advice from this also generalizes, since I see blogging as an exercise in idea generation (and there's nothing on writing): https://vihaansondhi.substack.com/p/how-to-be-a-great-blogger
	- **How to get to the frontiers of knowledge**: Good [[Evergreen Notes]], memory systems, srs systems, use this: https://guzey.com/personal/what-should-you-do-with-your-life/#how-to-actually-work-on-the-problem-you-like (and the rest of the post is really good too!)
	- **How to notice anomalies**: Spend more time doing personal notetaking (too many people believe that notetaking is something to do for other people's ideas. If you feel uncomfortable), 
	- **Other misc things**:
		- Surround yourself with the most best thinkers possible. If you're lucky, you'll have some friends that are good thinkers. Otherwise, surround yourself with content by people that are the best thinkers possible. For anything that particularly resonated, see if you can contact the writer and ask them what caused them to have their ideas. 
		- Triggers: many ideas come from a culmination of many triggers interacting serendipitously 
			- conversations: this is where being friends with smart people helps a ton as well
			- content: this is where being around good content helps as well
			- using some idea prompts with srs system: not sure whether this helps or harms, but i think to some degree it helps. An srs system can help ensure that the best prompt generators show up more often than other ones. 
		- Schedule your time intentional to avoid any one side taking over
			- Schedule some time for consumption
			- Schedule time for unstructured thinking (times without input but also without any structured questions)
			- Schedule time for active and structured thinking about a subject using [[Deep Work]]'s technique 
		- Make sure your knowledge accretes over time
			- SRS as an inbox for transient ideas that you can build on over time
			- Evergreen Note-taking as a way to add to your ideas over time
