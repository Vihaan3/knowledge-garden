Sometimes, instead of focusing on all the goals you want to achieve and all the things you want to do to achieve them, think about them in terms of what would stop me from achieving my goal.

For a project: Project yourself 1/2 a year in the future, and assume the project/goal/task failed. What brought this about? What roadblocks got in the way, what distractions stopped you, etc. Tell the story of how it failed and put a system in place that removes those things.

For productivity: “What if I wanted to decrease my focus? How do I end up distracted?” Figure out the things that distract you; that take you away from focus and lead to procrastination and bad habits, and subtract them from your life.
