Based on what I know from [[How to generate more good ideas]] and [[How to train yourself to think a certain way]]

- Read a lot from people who constantly search for gaps in the world to prime my brain to look for those
- Actively spend some time thinking each morning about gaps in the world 
- Intentionally not have anything particular to think about/listen to/consume during showers, walks, bike rides, chores, etc
- Use anki to quick-capture promising ideas and keep them in my orbit so that they can serve as prompts that continue to prime my brain
- Use [[Evergreen Notes]] and physical journaling to capture promising notes and expand them
