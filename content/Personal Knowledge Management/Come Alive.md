Realization sparked by:
1. My sister forcing me to watch camp rock
2. Listening to [Come Alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BURBlSYPmBU) 
3. Watching [Jacob Collier](https://w[]()ww.youtube.com/watch?v=IQvzX0Z3HE4) and this [review of him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08YtK1BRfTU)
4. Reading [How to Do Great Work](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html) (especially [[Do what's excitingly ambitious]])
5. Listening to the [Replacing Guilt Audiobook](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/guilt/episodes/Replacing-Guilt-full-audiobook-e13ct4d/a-a5vrdtu)

Proclamation to self: I've been following [shoulds](https://mindingourway.com/not-because-you-should/) for far too long. It's time to come alive and do what's excitingly ambitious. Stop spreading yourself too thin everyday and focus deeply on a few things that feel magical. Find the magic ([[Where's the magic]]).
