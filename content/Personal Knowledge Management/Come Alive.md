Realization sparked by:
1. My sister forcing me to watch camp rock
2. Listening to [Come Alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BURBlSYPmBU) 
3. Watching [Jacob Collier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQvzX0Z3HE4)
4. Reading [How to Do Great Work](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html) (especially do what's "excitingly ambitious")

- [ ] Write out the origin story above more fully

I've been following self-created shoulds for far too long. I should be working on this project, it's more impressive. I've also been stretching myself too thin. A little bit of music, a little bit of cp, a little bit of software development, a little bit of writing in the same day. I want to follow what's excitingly ambitious, and do what's excitingly ambitious at every moment of the day. I want to try and experiment and learn, and truly live the ideal that [[There is no speed limit]]. Follow your curiosity, learn, try, learn, **come alive**.
