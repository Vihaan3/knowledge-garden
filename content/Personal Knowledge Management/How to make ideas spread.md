To make something stand out, you need it to be remarkable. Not just as in cool or neat, but something worth making a remark about. Because that's how ideas spread. The biggest ideas are the ones that are unique and do something in a new, unheard of way. This follows the ideas about [[Contrarian Thinking]]. 

Advertising for the mass market has become a failure mode. It's much easier to be successful by targeting niche groups and passionate early adopters who could become obsessed. This echoes a lot of the advice from Sam Altman, Paul Graham, and Julian Shapiro that I've noted down [[How to (tech) Startup]] and [[How to Get Startup Ideas]]. Find a group that desperately cares about what you have to offer/say. 

It's also important to keep the idea of [[Ossification]] in mind.
