Basically I just ran a "what would an awesome founder look like" simulation in my head, and here's what I got.

- Takes ideation very seriously because innovating and ideation is critical at every level.
	- Follows [[How to generate more good ideas]] seriously
- great [[People Skills]]; really good at inspiring other people
	- Good at spotting and recruiting top talent, builds good [[Social Infrastructure]]
- innovates fast and consistently
	- builds this into the cultures that he creates
		- active tools for providing anonymous feedback, people are incentivized to give helpful feedback/ideas, people are given days/weeks off to explore their own ideas, monthly hackathons
