- Blow your own mind (feel what you're talking about and natural storytelling techniques will come out by themselves)
- Imagine yourself smiling from ear to ear while talking
- Use hooks to hide the answer until the end, and drag out climaxes
- Don't script it out fully, but write down a few important things you want to mention and let a general shape emerge as you speak
