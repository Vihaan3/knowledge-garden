To some extent, we can control the amount of luck we have in our lives. I've read a lot about this from somewhere, but I forget where exactly. There was even a study that some ppl are more disposed to luck than others because they're better at noticing patterns and taking advantage of opportunities. It follows that it makes sense to try to train myself with as many serendipity maximizers as possible. asdfasdfkjasjdfljaskdfj;aksdjf;aksdfj;akdsfj;aklsdjf
## Some Serendipity Maximizers I've Noticed
- [[Evergreen Notes]] for noticing ideas and pushing the frontiers of knowledge.
- 1-1s and talking to ppl for coming across new ideas and patterns of behavior.
- [[Cold Emailing]] for the same as 1-1s and also new opportunities.
- [[People Skills]] for being able to create the change you want to see in the world. This is probably even more important than things like building new innovative tools. 
- [[How to have good predictions]]
