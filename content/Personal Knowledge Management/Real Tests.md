I've become sick of all the fake tests that exist everywhere. Social tests are awful, and most of the tests in school are too "easy" [[School can't be comfortable]] for actual long-term learning to name a few. The job market and that whole thing looks mostly like a bunch of fake tests as well. 

Some real tests I love (no order)
- Programming
- Research
- Guitar
- Writing
