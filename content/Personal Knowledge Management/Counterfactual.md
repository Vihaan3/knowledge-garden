Counterfactual: alternate universe
If you just look at how much good you're doing, you miss on how much you could be doing.

I.e. in the Scared Straight thing, they saw that the ppl reduced crime over the years and assumed that meant success. But if you looked at other ppl who didn't participate, they did even less. So the counterfactual was actually better.

Imagine an alternate universe where you didn't participate in hackathons, competitive programming comps, etc. Would the world be better?
