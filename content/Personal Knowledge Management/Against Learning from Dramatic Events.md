Basically you should assign probabilities to things beforehand, and when something happens evaluate if it was in line with your probabilities. Update accordingly. 

I.e.: It was known in 2001 that there was a probability of a major terrorist attack. We shouldn't have overreacted so heavily. 

What the Learning from Dramatic Events mindset leads to is a reactionary mindset. This is something that should be taken account of better in institutional decision making.

One reason it's good to learn from dramatic events is because by human nature, we are made to overreact to something that seems like a right now threat, and when the vast majority of society tells you to do something, the politically popular thing to do is to overreact and overcorrect.
