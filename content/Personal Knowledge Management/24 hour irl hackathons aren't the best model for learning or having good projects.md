The only real value I can see in 24 hour irl hackathons is the fun and networking aspect, which is definitely valuable but I'm not sure how much. If you want to have truly good projects come out, you probably need an [[Enabling Environments]] 

For shipping, having something like buildspace is probably good and for learning, good [[Enabling Environments]] and enacted experiences + building your own projects without the time crunch of a hackathon are probably better.

The 24 hour nature makes hackathons costlier in terms of money spent by the organization and on participants, while not having substantially higher benefits than just having good [[Enabling Environments]] and incubators/accelerators like buildspace.
