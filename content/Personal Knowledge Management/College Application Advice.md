# Writing in the Activities Section Advice
## Elevator Pitch

Think about it like you're stuck in an elevator with your AO for only 15 seconds per activity. Thinking about the problem this way forces you to put your impact front and center. Frame your activity to showcase what you’ve _personally_ contributed and added to it.

  

Instead of:

  

_“I was on the varsity tennis team and played doubles and singles. I competed in different tournaments on weekends and we won state in 2021 and 2022.”_

  

Try:

  

_“I led the varsity tennis team to 1st place at States twice. I created a new pre-season camp to onboard new players and build team chemistry.”_

  

Notice how the first version focuses on the activity while the second version focuses on _your contribution_ to the activity? The second version is much more memorable to admissions officers, and it helps them see a fuller picture of you as a student.

  

Instead of

_“I was the president of the robotics club in senior year. We held weekly workshops, invited guest speakers, and competed in a competition every year.”_

  

Try:

  

_“I was elected president of the robotics club in senior year after leading our team to a top 5 finish in the FIRST Robotics Competition.”_
