This is really important. Let's say that you want to start up, but you're not sure what problems to work on. Everyone always tells you to be the kind of person that notices things that are missing, but how do you do that?

I'll start with how I trained myself to be better at noticing friction in my online life and with the computer tools I use.
- Read a lot from and talked a bit with people noticing these points of friction in random areas
- Scheduled time specifically to think about this kind of stuff
- Picked up [[Evergreen Notes]] at this time and used them to push the frontiers of my thought on this.
- Created an anki deck for my ideas, which ensures they repeat, and ensures that I think about them often
- Write down my ideas in journals 
- A lot of this probably has some sort of knowledge faucet type effect from [[How to generate more good ideas]], where I'm trying my brain to get better ideas and to pay more attention to the ideas that I have
