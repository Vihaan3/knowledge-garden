Hey! I'm Vihaan. 

I'm doing my best to learn and think more about the world, and I write all of my best thoughts here. Right now, I'm fascinated by the idea of building better tools for thought and improving serendipity ([[Serendipity Maximizers]], [[Serendipitous Idea-Formation]]).

There's three reasons these notes exist:
- I want to pressure myself to spend more time taking notes.
- I want to pressure myself to spend more time revising notes and making them more readable.
- I want to share more of my ideas online. 

Visit my [Substack](https://vihaansondhi.substack.com/about), for a more in-depth introduction. It's serving as my personal website until I create one.
