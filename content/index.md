## Me
Hey! I'm Vihaan. 

I'm doing my best to learn and think more about the world, and I write all of my best thoughts here. Right now, I'm fascinated by the idea of building tools that can augment cognition, and building [[Social Infrastructure]] Currently, I'm especially interested in serendipity ([[Serendipity Maximizers]], [[Serendipitous Idea-Formation]]) and [[Making Massive Input Better]].

Visit my [Substack](https://vihaansondhi.substack.com/about), for a more in-depth introduction. It's serving as my personal website until I create one. 

## These Notes

There's three reasons these notes are public:
- I want to pressure myself to spend more time taking notes.
- I want to pressure myself to spend more time revising notes and making them more readable.
- I want to share more of my ideas online. 

Ideally, all of my notes should be [Evergreen](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes), and I take a lot of inspiration from the way [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/), and [Jess Martin](https://notes.jessmart.in/Lab+Notebook/About+this+lab+notebook) take their notes. Unfortunately, most of these notes were taken before I decided to commit to taking [[Evergreen Notes]], but hopefully that's changed by the time you see this. 

*Quirky bug: The note dates update every time I sync this with my Obsidian notes (which is everyday), so the dates for every note will almost always be within the last few days.*

Common Abbreviations:
- TFT in place of tools for thought
- SRS in place of spaced repetition system
